Dynamically Optimized Cycling Navigation with Real-Time Adaptive Routing

##Introduction
Navigating urban environments on a bicycle can be challenging due to incomplete cycling networks, lack of dedicated bike lanes, and heavy traffic congestion. This project focuses on Dwarka, New Delhi, where cyclists face similar challenges.

We propose a real-time cycling route optimization model that prioritizes safer paths (service lanes, internal roads) and dynamically adapts to road closures and traffic conditions using online planning with rollouts.

##Features
‚úÖ Real-time adaptive route planning
‚úÖ Avoids unsafe roads & highways
‚úÖ Online planning with rollouts for better decision-making
‚úÖ Graph-based road network modeling using OpenStreetMap
‚úÖ Dynamic weight assignment for road conditions

##Installation & Usage
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cycling-navigation.git
cd cycling-navigation
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
